Run a simple local server (optional, recommended for testing JavaScript modules or fetch):

Notes:
- I used the repo metadata (owner, repo name, and live site) to populate this README. If you’d like, I can:
  - add project screenshots,
  - include exact build or framework commands if you provide them,
  - add an automated deploy badge (Vercel) or CI badges,
  - or commit this README directly to the repository for you.
